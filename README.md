# Analysis-of-LEGO-dataset


  Diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO,I answered a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

          What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

          In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

          Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

          When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

          Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
         
 
 
The following where done on the Notebook analysis
         
         
          Combined my Notebook with a HTML Markup.

          Applied Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames.

          Aggregated my data

          Created scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib.

          Related database schemas that are organised by primary and foreign keys.

          Merged DataFrames that share a common key

        The largest LEGO set ever produced has around 10,000 pieces! Apparently, only two of these boxes were ever produced, so if you wanted to get your hands on a            ridiculously large LEGO set, you'll have to settle for the 7,541 piece Millennium Falcon.



      we can see that LEGO published less than 10 different sets per year during its first few years of operation. But by 2019 the company had grown spectacularly, releasing 840 sets in that year alone!
      
      We also see that while the first 45 years or so, LEGO had some steady growth in its product offering, but it was really in the mid-1990s that the number of sets produced by the company increased dramatically! We also see a brief decline in the early 2000s and a strong recovery around 2005 in the chart.

In the chart, we can see that LEGO has pretty consistently added more and more themes until the mid-1990s. From then the number of themes has stagnated for around 10 years or so until the early 2010s.

From the chart, we can definitely make out an upward trend in the size and complexity of the LEGO sets based on the average number of parts. In the 2010s the average set contained around 200 individual pieces, which is roughly double what average LEGO set used to contain in the 1960s.


Niiiiice.😌 So what can we see here? Well, a couple of these themes like Star Wars, Town, or Ninjago are what I would think of when I think of LEGO. However, it looks like LEGO also produces a huge number of ... books and key chains?!?! I guess I'm showing my age here, but it's interesting that the LEGO company seems to produce so much more these days than just plastic bricks. The 'Gear' category itself is huge and includes everything from bags to pencil cases apparently. Has LEGO strayed from its core business or is it successfully diversifying? That we can't answer from our dataset. I'll leave that one up to a business school case study to decide. 🤷‍♀️
