# Analysis-of-LEGO-dataset


  Diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO,I answered a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

          What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

          In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

          Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

          When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

          Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

          Combined my Notebook with a HTML Markup.

          Applied Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames.

          Aggregated my data

          Created scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib.

          Related database schemas that are organised by primary and foreign keys.

          Merged DataFrames that share a common key

        The largest LEGO set ever produced has around 10,000 pieces! Apparently, only two of these boxes were ever produced, so if you wanted to get your hands on a            ridiculously large LEGO set, you'll have to settle for the 7,541 piece Millennium Falcon.



      we can see that LEGO published less than 10 different sets per year during its first few years of operation. But by 2019 the company had grown spectacularly, releasing 840 sets in that year alone!
